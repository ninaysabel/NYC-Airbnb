# NYC-Airbnb-Analysis
A project analyzing several variables to measure the intersectionality betweenuser engagement and NYC Airbnbs.
This primarily uses R Markdown which includes ggplot and plot_ly and is meant to be knitted to HTML format for optimal user-viewing. 
This is soon to be updated with a dashboard format using Shiny.
